# tableau-airbnb-guardian-article

the aim of this project was to create some data visuals that would fit into a story and style of a major news outlet. I chose The Guardian and used an open source Airbnb dataset accessed [here](http://insideairbnb.com/). I created the visuals in Tableau and used London borough GIS data accessed [here](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/6cdebf5d-c69b-4480-8c9c-53ab8a816b9d/statistical-gis-boundary-files-for-london) to get the map visual.

Exporting to pdf isn't super easy from Tableau so the quality of the pdf isn't amazing and also you lose the interactivity of the visuals, especially the filter halfway down the page which hasn't rendered very well as a pdf (on Tableau it is a slider).

All the source files are in this repo to be able to clone and have a look around.
